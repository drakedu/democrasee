# DemocraSee â€” See the Other Side

In one June 2019 [study](https://perceptiongap.us/media/zaslaroc/perception-gap-report-1-0-3.pdf) published by [More in Common](https://www.moreincommon.com/) by Global Director of Research, Stephen Hawkins; Co-Founder, Tim Dixon; and Associate Director of Research, Daniel Yudkin, "Democrats and Republicans imagine that almost twice as many people on the other side hold extreme views than really do." It is soberingly clear that many Americans have a profoundly prejudiced perception of each other. This polarization and pessimism in part results from the information bubbles that surround us and our unwillingness to exit them. Yet, even for those who are willing to step outside these echo chambers of thought, many do not have the time nor energy to engage with opposing ideology.

DemocraSee is here to help change that. DemocraSee is a web application for accessible discussions driven by machine learning that facilitate understanding of different political perspectives on divisive topics through various manners of explanation and levels of discourse.
